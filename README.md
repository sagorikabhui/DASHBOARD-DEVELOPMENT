DESCRIPTION:

Project Overview:

This project involves analyzing and visualizing student performance data using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The goal of this task is to uncover insights through interactive charts and dashboards based on a dataset that contains academic performance data of students along with demographic and background information.

Through this visualization task, we explore how various features such as gender, parental level of education, test preparation course, and lunch type influence student performance in math, reading, and writing. The visual insights help educators and academic institutions make data-informed decisions to improve student learning outcomes.


Dataset Description:

The dataset used is titled StudentsPerformance.csv, which includes the following columns:

gender (male/female)

race/ethnicity

parental level of education

lunch (standard or free/reduced)

test preparation course (completed/none)

math score

reading score

writing score


The dataset contains 1000 records in total, providing a rich base for analysis and visualization.


Task Workflow:

Step 1: Tableau Setup

We began by opening Tableau and connecting it to the CSV file StudentsPerformance.csv. Once connected, Tableau automatically detected and organized the dataset, allowing us to start building visualizations.

Step 2: Sheet 1 – Average Math Score by Gender

Columns: Gender

Rows: Math Score

Aggregation: Average This chart helped compare the average math scores between male and female students. The visual representation clearly highlighted gender-based differences in mathematical performance.


Step 3: Sheet 2 – Average Writing Score by Parental Education

Columns: Parental Level of Education

Rows: Writing Score (Average) This bar chart provided insight into how a parent's level of education affects the student’s writing performance. Sorting the bars in descending order helped enhance clarity and interpretation.

Step 4: Sheet 3 – Box Plot of Math Scores by Test Preparation Course

Columns: Test Preparation Course

Rows: Math Score

Chart Type: Box Plot (dragged from the Analytics pane) This box plot enabled comparison of the distribution and spread of math scores between students who completed the test preparation course and those who did not. It showed not only average scores but also the variance and outliers, providing deeper insight into the effectiveness of preparation.

Step 5: Sheet 4 – Scatter Plot of Reading vs Writing Scores

Columns: Reading Score

Rows: Writing Score

Detail: Gender (added to Color) This scatter plot explored the relationship between reading and writing scores and revealed a strong positive correlation. By coloring by gender, we were able to see potential patterns in performance clusters.

Step 6: Sheet 5 – Average Scores by Lunch Type

Columns: Lunch Type

Rows: Average Score (calculated field) A calculated field was created to represent the average of the three subject scores, allowing us to assess the impact of lunch type (standard or free/reduced) on overall performance.


Dashboard Creation:

After creating all five charts, we moved to the Dashboard section in Tableau:

Added a Vertical Container to manage layout and alignment.

Dragged each sheet into the container to create a scrollable, user-friendly interface.

Set the size to Automatic for better display on different devices.

Organized the layout for clarity and easy navigation.


Key Insights:

Students who completed the test preparation course consistently scored higher.

Standard lunch correlates with better average performance.

Higher parental education levels align with better student outcomes.

A strong correlation exists between reading and writing scores.

Gender differences were notable, especially in math and writing.


 Conclusion:

This task showcased the power of data visualization in storytelling and data-driven decision-making. By creating interactive and insightful visuals in Tableau, we converted raw student data into meaningful educational insights. These visuals can serve as effective tools for academic planning, curriculum adjustments, and personalized student support.

This project also builds strong foundational skills in Tableau, making it a valuable addition to any aspiring data analyst or data scientist’s portfolio.
